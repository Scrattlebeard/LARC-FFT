## Phase 1: Using online LLMs
- Can online LLMs complete the tasks, given examples and descriptions?
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet is much stronger than GPT-4o
   - GPT-4o gets close on problem 32
   - GPT-4o with code gets close too, but cannot find error in impl.
   - Try SVG generation?
   - Provide python utils?
- Can online LLMs generate descriptions from examples?
- How does fine-tuning change this?

## Phase 2: 
- Fine-tuning small models

## Phase 3: 
- Run on Kaggle
