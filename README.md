# Language-annotated Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (LARC)

This repository contains the language annotated data with supporting assets for LARC.

"LARC is a collection of natural language descriptions by a group of human participants, unfamiliar both with ARC and with each other, who instruct each other on how to solve ARC tasks."

The original ARC dataset can be found here [The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus github](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC)

Annotations in LARC takes form of a communication game, where 
one participant, the *describer* solves an ARC task and describes the underlying rules using language to a different participant, 
the *builder*, who must solve the task on the new input using the description alone.
